We are constantly bombarded with our own image on social media, in selfies and on the Zoom camera. We know that many people of all genders, ages and backgrounds are concerned about their body image.

We're here to help!

Our own [Dr Gemma Sharp](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/gemma-sharp) has led a team to develop a world's first chatbot called "JEM" who provides a 24/7 freely available voice of positive body image where people need it most - online.

### And you can help maximise the impact of JEM!

JEM is research driven and uses artificial intelligence (AI) to have human-like conversations. To read more about our research development of JEM, [click here](https://www.jmir.org/2021/6/e27807/).

Since launch in November 2020, the prior version of JEM - KIT version 1.0 has chatted with over 23,000 people via 133,000 text messages.

The research-based coping skills taught by JEM have led to significant improvements in the body image and mental health of our users. Here's JEM's [mindful selfie exercise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snuIhZpL-aU&amp;feature=youtu.be).

We're proud of what JEM has achieved so far, but JEM 1.0 employed the simplest form of AI and we're ready to make JEM more talkative and engaging for our users.

There is a huge demand for body image focused support and we need to grow our team and capabilities to meet that demand.

We know that with more advanced AI, JEM will be able to help more people and improve the psychological well-being of our users even more. This will mean that they do not go on to develop more serious mental health issues like eating disorders.
